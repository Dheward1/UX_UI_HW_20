                <p>Working as a UX designer on this project with two of my classmates, Em and Jean, We were tasked with
                    redesigning a non-profit website. We wanted a challenge so we chose Ballet West based on Em’s
                    negative
                    experience with the website in the past.</p>
                <h1 class="text-center">Why are we redesigning Ballet West?</h1>
                <p>balletwest.org has a confusing navigation system, underwhelming visuals, a convoluted ticket buying
                    and
                    money donation process. </p>
                <h1 class="text-center">Organization Description</h1>
                <p>Ballet West is an American ballet company based in Salt Lake City, Utah. It was founded in 1963 as
                    the
                    Utah Civic Ballet by Willam F. Christensen, the company's first artistic director, and Glenn Walker
                    Wallace, who served as its first president.</p>

                    and to donate, so here, we established two flows that we would reference to create our prototypes.

                <p>We wanted to honor the original brand colors of Ballet West since they did recently do a rebranding,
                    so we kept the black, gold, and white. But to help increase readability, we changed the background
                    color to black, and tried to use the gold really as an accent color instead of it being the primary
                    header color. We chose one display font as the large header, and the rest will be a variation of the
                    sans serif font, Lato. </p>

                <ul>
                    <li> Interviewing more qualified candidates during our research would have provided better insights.
                    </li>
                    <li> Coming up with a whole design system is a lot of work! Wish we had more time to spend on this
                        before building out our wireframes. </li>
                    <li>Testing is crucial and we definitely could have gone a dozen more sessions testing and iterating
                        before getting to a place that was ready to go live</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Revisiting User interviews with qualified candidates to discover better insights</li>
                    <li>Iterate on the app and test each function before moving to Hi-Fi</li>
                    <li>Develop and test the Donation portal</li>
